				<p>
By day the skyscraper looms in the smoke and sun and<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;has a soul.<br>
Prairie and valley, streets of the city, pour people into<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;it and they mingle among its twenty floors and are<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;poured out again back to the streets, prairies and<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;valleys.<br>
It is the men and women, boys and girls so poured in and<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;out all day that give the building a soul of dreams<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;and thoughts and memories.<br>
(Dumped in the sea or fixed in a desert, who would care<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;for the building or speak its name or ask a policeman<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;the way to it?)<br><br><br>

Elevators slide on their cables and tubes catch letters and<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;parcels and iron pipes carry gas and water in and<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;sewage out.<br>
Wires climb with secrets, carry light and carry words,<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;and tell terrors and profits and loves--curses of men<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;grappling plans of business and questions of women<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;in plots of love.<br><br><br>

Hour by hour the caissons reach down to the rock of the<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;earth and hold the building to a turning planet.<br>
Hour by hour the girders play as ribs and reach out and<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;hold together the stone walls and floors.<br><br><br>

Hour by hour the hand of the mason and the stuff of the<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;mortar clinch the pieces and parts to the shape an<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;architect voted.<br>
Hour by hour the sun and the rain, the air and the rust,<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;and the press of time running into centuries, play<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;on the building inside and out and use it.<br><br><br>

Men who sunk the pilings and mixed the mortar are laid<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;in graves where the wind whistles a wild song<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;without words<br>
And so are men who strung the wires and fixed the pipes<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;and tubes and those who saw it rise floor by floor.<br>
Souls of them all are here, even the hod carrier begging<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;at back doors hundreds of miles away and the brick-<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;layer who went to state's prison for shooting another<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;man while drunk.<br>
(One man fell from a girder and broke his neck at the<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;end of a straight plunge--he is here--his soul has<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;gone into the stones of the building.)<br><br><br>

On the office doors from tier to tier--hundreds of names<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;and each name standing for a face written across<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;with a dead child, a passionate lover, a driving<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;ambition for a million dollar business or a lobster's<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;ease of life.<br><br><br>

Behind the signs on the doors they work and the walls<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;tell nothing from room to room.<br>
Ten-dollar-a-week stenographers take letters from<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;corporation officers, lawyers, efficiency engineers,<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;and tons of letters go bundled from the building to all<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;ends of the earth.<br>
Smiles and tears of each office girl go into the soul of<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;the building just the same as the master-men who<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;rule the building.<br><br><br>

Hands of clocks turn to noon hours and each floor<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;empties its men and women who go away and eat<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;and come back to work.<br>
Toward the end of the afternoon all work slackens and<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;all jobs go slower as the people feel day closing on<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;them.<br>
One by one the floors are emptied. . . The uniformed<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;elevator men are gone. Pails clang. . . Scrubbers<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;work, talking in foreign tongues. Broom and water<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;and mop clean from the floors human dust and spit,<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;and machine grime of the day.<br>
Spelled in electric fire on the roof are words telling<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;miles of houses and people where to buy a thing for<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;money. The sign speaks till midnight.<br><br><br>

Darkness on the hallways. Voices echo. Silence<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;holds. . . Watchmen walk slow from floor to floor<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;and try the doors. Revolvers bulge from their hip<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;pockets. . . Steel safes stand in corners. Money<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;is stacked in them.<br>
A young watchman leans at a window and sees the lights<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;of barges butting their way across a harbor, nets of<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;red and white lanterns in a railroad yard, and a span<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;of glooms splashed with lines of white and blurs of<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;crosses and clusters over the sleeping city.<br>
By night the skyscraper looms in the smoke and the stars<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;and has a soul.<br>
