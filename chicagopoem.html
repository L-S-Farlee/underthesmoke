				HOG Butcher for the World,<br>
				Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat,<br>
				Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler;<br>
				Stormy, husky, brawling,<br>
				City of the Big Shoulders:<br><br><br>

				They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for I<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;have seen your painted women under the gas lamps<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;luring the farm boys.<br>
				And they tell me you are crooked and I answer: Yes, it<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;is true I have seen the gunman kill and go free to<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;kill again.<br>
				And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On the<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;faces of women and children I have seen the marks<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;of wanton hunger.<br>
				And having answered so I turn once more to those who<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;and say to them:<br>
				Come and show me another city with lifted head singing<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.<br>
				Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;job, here is a tall bold slugger set vivid against the<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;little soft cities;<br><br><br>

				Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action, cunning<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;as a savage pitted against the wilderness,<br>
						  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Bareheaded,<br>
						  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Shoveling,<br>
						  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Wrecking,<br>
						  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Planning,<br>
						  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Building, breaking, rebuilding,<br><br><br>
						  
				Under the smoke, dust all over his mouth, laughing with<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;white teeth,<br>
				Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;man laughs,<br>
				Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;never lost a battle,<br>
				Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse.<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;and under his ribs the heart of the people,<br>
							  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Laughing!<br>
				Laughing the stormy, husky, brawling laughter of<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;Youth, half-naked, sweating, proud to be Hog<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;Butcher, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with<br>
					 &emsp;&emsp;Railroads and Freight Handler to the Nation.<br>
